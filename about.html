            <p>I am Saurav Anand from India, currently working as a Network Operations Engineer at 42com Telecommunication GMBH/SAT Srl in Milan, Italy with a Master,s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Pavia, Italy and a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech,First Division with Honors) in Computer Science and Engineering from Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam Technical University, India.
            <p>My academic and professional background is strongly focused on computer networks, network architecture, network and information security, software-defined networking (SDN/SD-WAN), and cloud computing. During my Master’s program, I built a solid foundation through coursework in Advanced Computer Architecture, Advanced Computer Networks, Network Security, and cloud-based infrastructures, and later deepened my expertise in SD-WAN technologies, which became a central focus during the final phase of my studies.</p>
            <p>I completed my Master's Thesis at the <a href="https://peg.unipv.it/" target="_blank" class="underlined-link">Performance Evaluation Group Laboratory (University Lab)</a> carried out in collaboration with 42com while working full-time as a Network Operations Engineer, under Professor <a href="https://peg.unipv.it/MCC/bio.html" target="_blank" class="underlined-link"> Maria Carla Calzarossa</a> and <u>Dr. Karina Gomez (Technical Project Manager, 42com)</u>. The thesis, titled “SD-WAN Alarm Analysis: An Experimental Framework for Data-Driven Configuration Tuning and Predictive Fault Management in Large-Scale Deployments,” investigates the architecture and configuration behavior of SD-WAN alarm systems in large-scale deployments through an experimental, data-driven approach. It analyzes how tunable configuration parameters influence alarm accuracy, fault detection latency, and network observability, highlighting the architectural trade-offs between responsiveness and stability. The study demonstrates that systematic, analytics-driven alarm tuning is essential for scalable SD-WAN architectures, enabling improved monitoring efficiency, reduced alert fatigue, and more reliable operational performance.
            <p>Before enrolling into Masters Degree, I worked as an Associate network engineer (CISCO Networks) at Capgemini Engineering, India. During my one-year tenure at Capgemini, I provided technical support to clients, resolved complex network issues, and optimized network performance. As a former Network Engineer, I have developed a deep understanding of network protocols and technologies. Overall, my time as a Network Engineer has equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the field of network engineering. Along with this I have also worked as a Network/Automation Engineer Intern at Airports Authority of India during my 3rd year of  Bachelor’s Degree.</p><br>
            <p>I am passionate about learning new technologies, exploring new ideas, and tackling complex challenges. I approach every project with an open mind and a willingness to learn. Through my work, I strive to make meaningful contributions to the field and drive progress towards a more connected future.</p>
