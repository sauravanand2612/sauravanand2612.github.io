            <p>I am Saurav Anand. I am from India. I completed my Bachelor of Technology (2016-2020) with distinction marks in Computer Science and Engineering from Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam Technical University, India in 2020. I am currently a Master’s Student (2nd Level Master Degree) of Computer Engineering at University of Pavia, Italy and doing my Specialization in Computer Science and Multimedia (2022-2024). As an CSE student i have experience/ interest in writing Codes and software development. During my first year of Masters degree i mainly focused on two subjects i.e Advance Computer Architecture and Advance Computer Networks. As now i moved to second year of degree (2023-2024) i am now deep diving into two more subjects i.e Information Security and  Cloud Computing. </p><br>
            <p>I am mostly interested in Computer Networks concepts and Network Architecture. I worked as a CISCO TAC Engineer at Capgemini Engineering, India. As a CISCO TAC Engineer (Associate Network Engineer) I specialized in VOIP, CUCM, CUCX, and Webex technologies. During my one-year tenure, I provided technical support to clients, resolved complex network issues, and optimized network performance. Overall, my time as a Network Engineer has equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the field of network engineering, with a focus on CISCO technologies. As a former CISCO TAC Engineer, I have developed a deep understanding of network protocols and technologies. Building on this foundation, I have now shifted my focus to advance computer architecture and parallel computing in my Master’ Course along with Subjects like ----</p><br>
            <p>I am passionate about learning new technologies, exploring new ideas, and tackling complex challenges. Whether working on network design or exploring the frontiers of parallel computing, I approach every project with an open mind and a willingness to learn. Through my work, I strive to make meaningful contributions to the field and drive progress towards a more connected and efficient future.</p>
