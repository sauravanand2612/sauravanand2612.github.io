            <p>I am Saurav Anand and I am from India. I possess a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech, 2016-2020) degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam Technical University, India, achieved with distinction marks (1st- DIV-HONS) in 2020. Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Pavia, Italy.
                With a strong foundation in software development and coding, my primary interests lie in the realms of computer networks, architecture, and security, alongside cloud computing. In the initial phase of my Master’s journey, I delved into Advanced Computer Architecture and Advanced Computer Networks, honing my expertise in these areas and when I progressed into the second year of my degree, my focus shifted towards network and information security, and cloud computing.</p><br>
            <p>I am currently working in <a href="https://peg.unipv.it/" target="_blank" class="underlined-link">Performance Evaluation Group Lab</a> on my Master's Thesis under Professor <a href="https://peg.unipv.it/MCC/bio.html" target="_blank" class="underlined-link"> Maria Carla Calzarossa</a>, which focuses on the performance evaluation of traditional network infrastructures as they integrate with IoT devices using the MQTT protocol. My research focuses on analyzing the network's performance while doing some changes in bandwidth, load, latency, and throughput within the MQTT protocol, and also evaluating the performance of the MQTT protocol in particular within these environments and changes. Additionally, I am assessing the impact of security breaches and attacks like DDoS and overload on both the 
                network infrastructure and MQTT performance. This work builds on my expertise in network engineering, allowing me to design and optimize secure, scalable, and resilient network infrastructures and also modern IoT infrastructure deployments.</p><br>
            <p>Before enrolling into Masters Degree, I worked as an Associate network engineer (CISCO Networks) at Capgemini Engineering, India. During my one-year tenure at Capgemini, I provided technical support to clients, resolved complex network issues, and optimized network performance. As a former Network Engineer, I have developed a deep understanding of network protocols and technologies. Overall, my time as a Network Engineer has equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the field of network engineering. Along with this I have also worked as a Network/Automation Engineer Intern at Airports Authority of India during my 3rd year of  Bachelor’s Degree.</p><br>
            <p>I am passionate about learning new technologies, exploring new ideas, and tackling complex challenges. I approach every project with an open mind and a willingness to learn. Through my work, I strive to make meaningful contributions to the field and drive progress towards a more connected future.</p>
